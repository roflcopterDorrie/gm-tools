# Game master tools

Interface to help plan and manage table top gaming for dungeon masters.

## Goals

 * Easily record interactions between players and everything (NPCs, places, story line choices)
 * Easily see player skills (eg perception checks, tool proficiencies)
 * Create and display info about places, characters, tasks, treasure, encounters, traps
 * Quick navigation between everything (places, characters, maps, tasks)
 * Track gold and magic items given to players (for balancing in the campaign as well as between players)
 * GM cheat sheet on checks, DCs, stuff that is on a board
 * Show maps in a seperate screen for use in on a TV battlefield
 * Encounter monster tracker for HP/conditions
 * Able to cross reference easily (eg show me all NPCs in a place as well as show me all the places for this NPC)
 * Links into dnd beyond (monsters, treasure, etc)
